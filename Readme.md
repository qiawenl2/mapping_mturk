# As-if mapping Game

_This project was generated with [create-empirica-app](https://github.com/empiricaly/create-empirica-app)._

## Experiment Demo:

You and your partner can play with this experiment as we ran it by following these instructions (assuming you have [Meteor installed](https://www.meteor.com/install)):

1. [Download](https://github.com/qiawenl2/mapping) the repository (and unzip). Alternatively, from terminal just run:

```ssh
git clone https://github.com/qiawenl2/mapping.git
```

2. Go into the folder with `cd mapping
3. Install the required dependencies by running `meteor npm install`
4. Edit the `admin` password in the settings file `local.json` to something you like.
5. Run the local instance with `meteor --settings local.json`
6. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin` (or whatever port you are running Meteor on).
7. login with the credentials username: `admin` and the password you have in `local.json`
8. Start a new batch with whatever configuration you want (see the example configuration).

### Example Config:

First, you have to enter the Configuration mode instead of the Monitoring model in the admin UI.

![config-mode][config-mode-image]

[config-mode-image]: ./readme_screenshots/configuration_mode.png

This will allow you to configure the experiment: Factors, Lobby, and Treatments:

![config-mode-inside][config-mode-inside-image]

[config-mode-inside-image]: ./readme_screenshots/configuration_mode_inside.png

Now, you have the option to create the configuration by `import` and then choosing the file `./mapping_game.yaml`.

Then, you can go back to the Monitoring mode:

Now the **_Batchs_** tab make sure you add a new batch, add the treatments you want, choose your lobby configurations, and then **_start_** the batch.

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and enjoy! If
## Changing the experiment to make it your own

The experiment is built with Empirica, which is based on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) web
development framework. In Empirica, the code is split in 2 main categories: code
running on the **client** (the browser) and code running on the **server**.
This functional separation is immediately reflected in the folders structure.

### Client

All code in the `/client` directory will be ran on the client. The entry point
for your app on the client can be found in `/client/main.js`. In there you will
find more details about how to customize how a game _Round_ should be rendered,
what _Consent_ message and which _Intro Steps_ you want to present the players
with, etc.

The HTML root of you app in `/client/main.html` shouldn't generally be changed
much, other than to update the app's HTML `<head>`, which contains the app's
title, and possibly 3rd party JS and CSS imports.

All styling starts in `/client/main.less`, and is written in
[LESS](http://lesscss.org/), a simple superset of CSS. You can also add a plain
CSS files in `/client`.

The `/client/game`, `/client/intro`, `/client/exit` directories all contain
[React](https://reactjs.org/) components, which compose the UI of your app.
If you are new to React, we recommend you try out the official
[React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

### Server

Server-side code all starts in the `/server/main.js` file. In that file, we set
an important Empirica integration point, the `Empirica.gameInit`, which allows
to configure each game as they are initiated by Empirica.

From there we import 2 other files. First the `/server/callback.js` file, which
contains all the possible callbacks used in the lifecycle of a game. These
callbacks, such as `onRoundEnd`, offer powerful ways to add logic to a game in a
central point (the server), which is often preferable to adding all the logic on
the client.

Finally, the `/server/bots.js` file is where you can add bot definitions
to your app.

### Public

The `/public` is here to host any static assets you might need in the game, such
as images. For example, if you add an image at `/public/my-logo.jpeg`, it will
be available in the app at `http://localhost:3000/my-logo.jpeg`.

### Settings

We generated a basic settings file (`/local.json`), which should originally only
contain configuration for admin login. More documentation for settings is coming
soon.

You can run the app with the settings like this:

```sh
meteor --settings local.json
```

## Updating Empirica Core

As new versions of Empirica become available, you might want to update the
version you are using in your app. To do so, simply run:

```sh
meteor update empirica:core
```
